# Substarters

Open source bot collection used in the Substarters Discord community.

The project will be divided into several sub-projects based on the "personality" of the bot within the Substarters theme.

* Substar:   The star of our community who is in charge of community management. 
                Things like welcoming messages, auto-poll interactions, etc. will be under this subproject.

* Submoon:   The assistant in charge of advertisement and public relations.

                No content yet.

* Subcomet:  The punk type rebel with a cause. He will go out and collect data through surveys, polls and observation.
