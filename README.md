# Substarters

Bot collection used in the Substarters Discord community.

The project will be divided into several sub-projects based on the "personality" of the bot within the Substarters theme.

* **Substar**:   The star and face of our community who is in charge of community management. 

* **Submoon**:   The big sister in charge of advertisement and public relations. She collects data and finds new members and subreddits.

* **Subsolar**:  The little sister whose main purpose is being super adorable. She'll help you by looking up information and sharing it with you.

* **Subcomet**:  The punk type rebel with a cause. He gives the community a voice through feedback, polls and surveys.
